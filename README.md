THE BACKEND: How I Built This Farm
- The Inspiration:
I wanted to bring my love for all things farm-related into the digital world. Instead of just looking at pictures of farms, I used Scratch to
create a "living" farm where you can interact with characters like Rooster Rob and Gwen Hen. Every sprite and sound was chosen to make you feel
like you're right there in the barnyard.
- Coding the Logic:
When the Replay button is clicked, it sends a "RESET" signal, allowing everyone to return to their designated places.
- Problem Solving:
Just like fixing a fence on a real farm, I had to "debug" the game. I ensured that Rooster Rob shrinks back to normal size when a new game starts,
and that Gwen Hen stops running the moment the game is over, so the scores remain accurate.
- Personalization:
I used Sensing blocks so the game actually listens to you. By asking for your name, the game becomes a personal experience between you and our farm animals.

HOW TO PLAY: The Farm Master Egg Catch!
1. Meet Rooster Rob:
When you click the Green Flag, Rooster Rob will appear to welcome you to the farm. Please type your name when he asks so he knows who his new farmhand is!
2. Move the Bowl:
Use the Left and Right Arrow Keys on your keyboard to slide the bowl back and forth at the bottom of the screen.
3. Catch the Eggs:
Gwen Hen is busy up at the top! Try to catch every egg she drops into your bowl to earn points.
4. Watch Your Lives:
You start with 3 lives. If an egg hits the ground and "crunches," you lose one life.
5. Beat the Speed:
Every 10 seconds, the eggs will start falling a little faster, so stay alert!
6. Play Again: 
Once the game is over, Rooster Rob will tell you your final score. Just click the REPLAY button to start the farm fun all over again!
